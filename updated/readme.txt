!!!ALWAYS HAVE A BACKUP BEFORE REPLACING A GAMEDATA FILE!!!

This directory contains the gamedata.db file you will REPLACE your PROD .db file with on your HOSTING MACHINE. This will udpate the gamedata for your players such that:

1) It contains your new changes (new items, quests, variables, etc)
2) It retains the values of existing server variables that your players have set while playing
